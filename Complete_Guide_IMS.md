# Complete Guide for Collaborative Development of the Inventory Management System (IMS)

This guide provides a detailed breakdown of how to efficiently collaborate on developing an Inventory Management System (IMS) using GitHub, dividing the work across multiple versions, and managing the workflow.

## Version 1 (V1): Basic Inventory Management

### Modules and Responsibilities:

1. **User A: Product Management**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Develop the basic functionalities to add, update, and delete products.
     - Design the `Product` class structure, including fields like `Product ID`, `Product Name`, and `Quantity`.
   - **Branch:** `feature/product-management`

2. **User B: Inventory Tracking**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Implement a basic inventory tracking system.
     - Develop features to monitor stock levels and provide alerts for low stock.
   - **Branch:** `feature/inventory-tracking`

3. **User C: User Interface (UI)**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Create a simple user interface using JavaFX.
     - Ensure the UI allows users to add, update, and view products.
   - **Branch:** `feature/ui`

### Development Process:
- **Feature Branches:** Each user works on their assigned module in a separate feature branch to prevent conflicts and enable independent development.
- **Integration:** 
  - Ensure that the modules are designed to interact via well-defined interfaces.
  - For example, the `UI` module will call methods from the `Product Management` and `Inventory Tracking` modules.
- **Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for each module to verify functionality.
  - Test each feature branch independently before merging it into the `main` branch via a pull request.

## Version 2 (V2): Advanced Inventory Features

### Modules and Responsibilities:
1. **User A: Advanced Product Management**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Expand the `Product` class to include more details like categories and suppliers.
     - Implement search and filter functionalities.
   - **Branch:** `feature/advanced-product-management`

2. **User B: Enhanced Inventory Tracking**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Add batch processing features for bulk adding or updating products.
     - Implement inventory history tracking.
   - **Branch:** `feature/enhanced-tracking`

3. **User C: Enhanced Reporting**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Develop detailed reporting features (e.g., sales reports, stock level reports).
     - Implement data export options and integrate basic analytics.
   - **Branch:** `feature/enhanced-reporting`

### Development Process:
- **Feature Branches:** Continue using dedicated feature branches for each new functionality.
- **Review & Testing:**
  - Use pull requests for code review.
  - Expand test coverage to include new features and ensure all modules work together.

## Version 3 (V3): Integration and Optimization

### Modules and Responsibilities:
1. **User A: API Integration**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Integrate the IMS with external systems (e.g., supplier APIs).
     - Implement real-time updates with external systems.
   - **Branch:** `feature/api-integration`

2. **User B: Performance Optimization**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Optimize system performance to handle larger datasets.
     - Implement caching strategies and optimize database queries.
   - **Branch:** `feature/performance-optimization`

3. **User C: Security and User Management**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Introduce user roles (e.g., admin, viewer) with specific permissions.
     - Implement security features like data encryption and audit logs.
   - **Branch:** `feature/security`

### Development Process:
- **Feature Branches:** Continue using feature branches for API integration, optimization, and security enhancements.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Use CI tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
  - Ensure that every push to a branch triggers automated tests.
- **Review & Deployment:** Thoroughly test the new features before merging them into the main branch.

## Version 4 (V4): Final Version with All Features

### Modules and Responsibilities:
1. **User A: User Experience (UX) Refinement**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Refine the UI for better user experience, adding advanced features like drag-and-drop and real-time updates.
   - **Branch:** `feature/ux-refinement`

2. **User B: Scalability**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Prepare the system for large-scale deployment.
     - Implement distributed processing, load balancing, and other scalability features.
   - **Branch:** `feature/scalability`

3. **User C: Final Testing and Documentation**
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure all modules work seamlessly together.
     - Document the system thoroughly, including user guides and technical documentation.
   - **Branch:** `feature/final-testing-documentation`

### Development Process:
- **Final Integration:** Bring all modules together and ensure smooth interaction.
- **Final Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on the overall systemâ€™s stability and performance.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the final version to the production environment.

## General GitHub Workflow for All Versions

### 1. Avoid Direct Push to Main:
- **Main Branch (`main` or `master`)**: Should always be stable and contain fully tested code.
- **Feature Branches:** Always create and work on feature branches. Avoid pushing directly to the main branch to prevent unstable or incomplete code from being deployed.

### 2. Code Reviews:
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Use PRs to merge feature branches into the main branch.
- **Review Process:** Before merging, each PR should be reviewed by at least one other team member to ensure code quality and catch potential issues.

### 3. Use CI/CD Pipelines:
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests on every commit and pull request.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Consider using CD for automatic deployment to a staging environment after successful tests.

### 4. Regular Communication:
- **Daily Stand-ups or Weekly Meetings:** Regularly discuss progress, challenges, and next steps to ensure everyone is aligned.
- **Documentation:** Keep documentation up to date, including module descriptions, API endpoints, user guides, and any known issues.

### Summary
By dividing the work into manageable modules, using GitHub feature branches, conducting regular code reviews, and setting up CI/CD pipelines, your team can efficiently build a robust and scalable Inventory Management System in multiple versions.
